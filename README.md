# Image-Searching-React-App
This app lets the user search images according to their needs. I used the unsplash wallpaper api to fetch high quality images in the real time.Used the javascript library axios to make the api call.
// how to run this application 1.download and install node(version used:v18.16.0) 2.use the terminal to create a react app with 'command npx create-react-app pics' 3.change the directory by using command 'cd pics' 4.Run the project using the command 'npm start'

note: 1.create a seperate folder 'src' in the app directory for all js and css files. 2.create a seperate folder 'public' in the app directory for the html file.
